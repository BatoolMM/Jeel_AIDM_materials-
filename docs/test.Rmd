```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "DT", "palmerpenguins", "distill", "bookdown", "rticles", "gapminder", "prettydoc", "plotly"))
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. You can also make interactive plots.


```{r}
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)

data <- gapminder %>% filter(year=="2007") %>% dplyr::select(-year)

# Most basic bubble plot
p <- data %>%
      arrange(desc(pop)) %>%
      mutate(country = factor(country, country)) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size=pop, color=continent)) +
      geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
      scale_size(range = c(.1, 24), name="Population (M)")

ggplotly(p)

```

## Changing themes

You can update the 'look' of your html document by changing the `theme` option in the `yaml`. Look here for all the free bootswatch themes that are compatible with R markdown html document <https://bootswatch.com/3/>.
